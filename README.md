# Website with angular 6.0

This is the code for my dad's website. I was debating but at the end I figured there is no downside to having the code in a public repo.
I hope this repo is some use to others who consider building a (more or less) static website with bootstrap 5 and angular, which I find kind of cool, easy to deploy (we are running on 1and1 and small in code (all js + index.html)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.3.

## Build

Run `ng build --prod` to build the project, create a dist directory and ftp the tca )in my case) to the server - done!.
